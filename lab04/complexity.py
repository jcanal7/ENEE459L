    """Bytes of stored tensors: parameters plus buffers, at their own dtypes.

    Lecture 04 slide 8 gives the formula as `#Parameters × bit width` and slide
    9 spends a page on why the file on disk is not that number. Three reasons,
    two of which this function has to get right:

      * a model is not stored in one dtype. `Layer.weight_dtype` is per layer
        and a network with FP16 weights and FP32 normalisation is completely
        ordinary. Multiplying a single total by a single bit width is the
        mistake, and on these four descriptions it is worth several per cent
      * buffers are in the file. Batch norm's running statistics are two
        vectors per channel that no optimiser ever touched, and they are still
        bytes you have to ship
      * the container is in the file too — the pickle framing, the state-dict
        keys, the archive directory. This function does *not* try to model
        that, and it says so in `container_overhead_excluded` rather than
        quietly letting the caller assume it did

    Returns a `computed` finding whose value is bytes, with the per-dtype
    breakdown that makes the first bullet checkable.

    UNC COMP 790-150 Lec 2 p. 70 gives AlexNet as total 932,264 and peak
    440,928, and the two numbers answer two different questions. Total is what
    the whole forward pass produced. Peak is how much had to be resident at
    once, and peak is the one that decides whether the model runs.

    Peak is not `max(out_elements)`. Three things make it larger than that:

      * a layer's input is still resident while its output is being written.
        The live set at layer *i* contains both
      * a tensor consumed by a later layer stays resident in between. `add`
        layers name two inputs in `Layer.reads`, and the earlier one has been
        sitting in memory across every layer of the block. This is the residual
        connection and it is the single largest contributor to peak in
        ResNet-shaped networks
      * the network's own input is a tensor too

    The implementation is a liveness pass: work out the last layer that reads
    each tensor, then walk forward keeping a live set and taking the maximum of
    its total size. Anything simpler than that is wrong on any graph with a
    skip connection, and it is wrong quietly, in the direction that says the
    model fits.

    Returns a `computed` finding whose value is peak *bytes*, because bytes are
    what a memory budget is denominated in, with elements and the layer where
